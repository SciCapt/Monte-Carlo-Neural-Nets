    def __init__(self, inputCount: int, hiddenCounts: list, outputCount: int, activations):
        """
        Create a deep neural network from the given counts of neurons requested per layer.

        Inputs:

        1 - inputCount
        - Type == int
        - Range == (0, inf]

        2 - hiddenCounts
        - Type == List of int
        - Range == (0, inf]

        3 - outputCount
        - Type == int
        - Range == (0, inf]

        4 - activations
        - Possible Values: "NONE", "ELU", "ATAN", "RELU", "SIG"
            - NONE: No applied function
            - ELU: Exponential up to x=0, then uses y=x
            - ATAN: Uses arctan(x)
            - RELU: max(x, 0)
            - SIG: Sigmoid function
        - A list of different functions per layer can be given, otherwise, all calculation
          steps will use the single given activation function.
        - Examples:
            - AdvNet(1, [10, 20, 10], 2, "RELU") 
                - 5-layer net / 4 in-between spaces
                - Uses the "RELU" activation function for all (4) in-between spaces.
            - AdvNet(2, [15, 15], 5, ["RELU", "ELU", "ATAN"]) 
                - 4-layer net / 3 in-between spaces
                - Uses RELU in between layers 1 & 2, ELU in between layers 2 & 3, and 
                ATAN in between layers 3 & 4.

        Operation:

        A deep neural network is generated from the requested sizes, with 
        the initial weights set to random parameters in the range [-1, 1].
        The values given are directly used to create the amount of neurons
        for the specific layer.

        The layer's heights are in the order given, that is:

        > inputCount, hiddenCounts[0], hiddenCounts[1], ... hiddenCounts[n-1], outputCount

        Where n is just the length of the given hiddenCounts list given.

        For each step of forward propogation (n-1 total steps / spaces) an activation function
        is referenced from the activation functions that the net has (use print(net) to see these).
        If only one type was provided in the nets creation, all possible spaces use just this 
        activation type.

    def TweakWeights(self, Amplitude: float, Selection='all', returnChange:bool = False):
        """
        Adjust the weights of a neural net by a given amplitude. The net change in the 
        weight arrays can be optionally returned for gradient decent calculation later.
        
        Inputs:

        1 - Amplitude
        - Type == float
        - Range == (0, inf]*

        2 - Selection
        - Type == List (or 'gates' or 'middle')
        - Used to select specific weight set(s) to train instead of training all weights.
        Useful for making sure the first and last sets of weights are trained correctly to
        avoid 'gate keeping'.
        - The string 'gates' can be used to select the first and last weight arrays to train
        while 'middle' can be used to select all weight arrays (if any) in between the 'gates'.

        
        Operation:

        For a weight array of a given size, an array of random values is
        generated of the same size. These values are random float values
        in the range [0,1].
        
        The range of these values is transformed to a middle of 0 by subtracting 0.5.
        By then multiplying by 2*Amplitude, the new range becomes [-Amplitude, Amplitude].

        The net weights are clipped to the range [-1,1], therefore, an amplitude magnitude 
        above 1 is rather aggressive. Typical starting values include 0.2, 0.02, etc. and
        can be decreased to achieve finer tuning.

        Selection can be used to only tweak a specfic set of ranges, or even just a single one
        for even finer tuning of the parameters. Any indicies given in Selection that are out 
        of the range of weight arrays are ignored.

    Train a specified neural net to the given validation data, using the 
    input data as the input vector to the net. Returns the trained net
    and the final average error after completion. Note the error is 
    found from the sum-square error divided amoung the number of data points.

    Inputs:

    1 - Net
    - Type == String or AdvNet
    - Looks for size and weights files with the given net name to load. If a 
    neural net is provided instead, this is simply the net used. If loading a 
    net, the size and weight files created from SaveNN(name) are gathered from
    their specific name made when generated. So pls don't change their names, thx.

    2 - inputData
    - Type == Numpy Array or List of (Numpy) Vectors
    - Size == # of unique data lists = Net input size
    - If an array is given, the columns should be the data points of that inputs

    3 - yData
    - Type == Numpy Array or List

    4 - startingTweakAmp
    - Type == Float
    - The starting amplitude used for tweaking the weight arrays, explained more in
    the tweakWeights() information.

    5 - plotLive
    - Type == Bool
    - Decides if pyplot is used to give a live visualization of the training.
    Currently just the first set of data/validation data are plotted against eachother

    6 - plotReults
    - Type == Bool
    - For the sake of speed, if a visualization is prefered but only needed after training
    this is the option to use. A plot of the net's predictions are plotted only after the
    trianing has finished.

    7 - normalizeData
    - Type == Bool
    - Decides of data is to be normalized according to its mean and standard
    deviation. This is particularly useful when there are multiple unique input
    data sets, with very different values.
    - If True, the mean and std. dev. of the validation data is used as the values
    to de-normalize the net's outputs

    8 - hiddenFunc
    - Type == String
    - Decides what hidden-layer processing should be used. 'NONE' simply passes
    through each summed up vector to the next layer with no processing. The default,
    'ELU', uses the function max(val, 0) before passing on to the next hidden layer.

    9 - trainWeights
    - Type == List (or 'gates' or 'middle')
    - Used to select specific weight set(s) to train instead of training all weights.
    Useful for making sure the first and last sets of weights are trained correctly to
    avoid 'gate keeping'.
    - The string 'gates' can be used to select the first and last weight arrays to train
    while 'middle' can be used to select all weight arrays (if any) in between the 'gates'.

    10 - maxIterations
    - Type == Int
    - Used to set an upper limit of training iterations. If no useful training is completed
    within a few hundred iterations (depending on tweak amplitude, 0.4 means 300 iterations),
    the training will end, assuming the maxIterations is greater than this limit.

    11 - blockSize
    - Type == Int
    - Used for determining how quickly the tweak amplitude is decreased from its starting value.
    Every blockSize # of iterations, if no improvements are made, the tweak amplitude is 
    divided by a factor of two. This progresses training and is what makes the automatic
    detection of how fine the net should be trained, possible. Training is ended once max 
    iterations are reached or the tweak amplitude gets to be very small (< 5e-4).

    12 - Silent
    - Type = Bool
    - Decides if the current error and iteration shouldn't be printed to the console.

    **** Depreceated since version 0.2.0 ****

    Train a specified neural net to the given validation data, using the 
    input data as the input vector to the net. Returns the trained net
    and the final average error after completion. Note the error is 
    found from the sum-square error divided amoung the number of data points.

    Inputs:

    1 - Net
    - Type == String or AdvNet
    - Looks for size and weights files with the given net name to load. If a 
    neural net is provided instead, this is simply the net used. If loading a 
    net, the size and weight files created from SaveNN(name) are gathered from
    their specific name made when generated. So pls don't change their names, thx.

    2 - inputData
    - Type == Numpy Array or List of (Numpy) Vectors
    - Size == # of unique data lists = Net input size
    - If an array is given, the columns should be the data points of that inputs

    3 - yData
    - Type == Numpy Array or List

    4 - startingTweakAmp
    - Type == Float
    - The starting amplitude used for tweaking the weight arrays, explained more in
    the tweakWeights() information.

    5 - plotLive
    - Type == Bool
    - Decides if pyplot is used to give a live visualization of the training.
    Currently just the first set of data/validation data are plotted against eachother

    6 - plotReults
    - Type == Bool
    - For the sake of speed, if a visualization is prefered but only needed after training
    this is the option to use. A plot of the net's predictions are plotted only after the
    trianing has finished.

    7 - normalizeData
    - Type == Bool
    - Decides of data is to be normalized according to its mean and standard
    deviation. This is particularly useful when there are multiple unique input
    data sets, with very different values.
    - If True, the mean and std. dev. of the validation data is used as the values
    to de-normalize the net's outputs

    8 - hiddenFnc
    - Type == String
    - Decides what hidden-layer processing should be used. 'NONE' simply passes
    through each summed up vector to the next layer with no processing. The default,
    'ELU', uses the function max(val, 0) before passing on to the next hidden layer.

    9 - trainWeights
    - Type == List (or 'gates' or 'middle')
    - Used to select specific weight set(s) to train instead of training all weights.
    Useful for making sure the first and last sets of weights are trained correctly to
    avoid 'gate keeping'.
    - The string 'gates' can be used to select the first and last weight arrays to train
    while 'middle' can be used to select all weight arrays (if any) in between the 'gates'.

    10 - maxIterations
    - Type == Int
    - Used to set an upper limit of training iterations. If no useful training is completed
    within a few hundred iterations (depending on tweak amplitude, 0.4 means 300 iterations),
    the training will end, assuming the maxIterations is greater than this limit.

    11 - maxCycles
    - Type == Int
    - Sets an upper limit to how many training cycles can be done.

    12 - blockSize
    - Type == Int
    - Used for determining how quickly the tweak amplitude is decreased from its starting value.
    Every blockSize # of iterations, if no improvements are made, the tweak amplitude is 
    divided by a factor of two. This progresses training and is what makes the automatic
    detection of how fine the net should be trained, possible. Training is ended once max 
    iterations are reached or the tweak amplitude gets to be very small (< 5e-4).

    13 - Silent
    - Type = Bool
    - Decides if the current error and iteration shouldn't be printed to the console.
